# Calculator!

**What?** A simple calculator built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  

**When?** It took me about four days in August 2021 *(2 months into my coding journey)*.  

**Where?** See it live [on GitHub Pages](https://tramio.github.io/TOP-calculator/).

## Challenges:
- As someone who had been mainly (well, âœ¨ only âœ¨) using CSS Flexbox, I decided to give CSS Grid a try for this project. It turned out to be pretty logical *(where are my battleship pals at)*, yet I couldn't help but find it limiting compared to Flexbox. I'll need to look into the cases where Grid / Flexbox should be privileged. 
- Because I chose to have all my buttons generated with JavaScript to prevent HTML repetition, I ended up having to change the order of my array elements for the buttons to fall in the right place.
- Adding the decimal input revealed some logic issues in my conditionals. Time to review when I should use "===" rather than "=="!

## Discoveries:
- CSS direction and text-overflow properties (ended up using none of them, but they'll definitely prove useful in the future!)
- CSS gradients: Duminda Perera's Minimalist Color Palettes and cssgradient.io

## Notes:
- Making smaller functions helps so much debugging!
- CSS animations ðŸ’•

## Things I need to learn more about:
- RegEx
- Better commit messages
- When it is more relevant to use CSS Grid / CSS Flexbox
- When it is more relevant to create buttons manually in HTML / generate them with a loop in JavaScript
